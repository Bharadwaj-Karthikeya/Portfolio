        <p>
            I am a dedicated UX/UI designer with experience in creating user-friendly designs and developing engaging user interfaces. My passion lies in blending creativity with technology trying to always deliver exceptional user experiences.
            <br><br>
            I specialize in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and front-end development. My goal is to craft intuitive and visually appealing digital products that resonate with users and meet business objectives.
            <br><br>
            Alongside my design skills, I have a strong foundation in frontend development and full-stack frameworks like MERN stack, enabling me to bring designs to life with clean and efficient code.
            <br><br>
            I also have a growing knowledge in C++, C#, Python languages and interests in AI/ML and Cloud.
